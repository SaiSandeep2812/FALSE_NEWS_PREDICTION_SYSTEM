Developed a fake news prediction system using textual data to classify news articles as real or fake. Implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. Built and trained machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to achieve high classification accuracy. Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in word usage and linguistic features, optimizing the model's performance. Utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK for implementation.
